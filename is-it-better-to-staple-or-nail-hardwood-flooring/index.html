Nails Ive used both and when researching buying a nailer or stapler I found no conclusive answer or grounds that one was any better than the other. Kind of like a sticky coating applied to the nails to add greater grabbing power when it is installed into the subfloor. Pin On Podea Lemn.</p>

<p>Typically the flooring is blind nailed through the tongue a portion of the wood plank that protrudes from the board and fits into the groove of the adjacent board. Clearly it is much easier to nail down a floor than to glue it down. The adhesive approach is generally used when installing over concrete. Because each staple grips the wood with two prongs staples provide a tighter initial grip than cleat nails.

<p>Each has its advantages but the success of either method will depend on the size and length of the nails or staples that are used. Cleats are the way to go. The problem with pneumatic nailers is you CANNOT get as tight a floor as with a manual nailer. Cleats are around the same price as flooring staples but have less availability.
