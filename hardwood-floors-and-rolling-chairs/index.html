<p>Written by Durbany in hardwood floor. I used to have tile flooring but when I moved nearly every room has hardwood floors which is damn nice but also very easily scuffed and now I cant use my office chairs and have been stuck with felt padded regular chairs and its very uncomfortable after a long period of work. Clean it regularly to get rid of stubborn dirt that can rub against your wooden flooring. I dont doubt that urethane casters will not cause damage to hardwood but standard office chairs do.
