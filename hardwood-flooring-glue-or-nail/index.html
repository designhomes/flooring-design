<p>No wonder this increases your costs significantly. Engineered hardwood products may be fastened stapled or glued on above or below grade. This isnt really how hard hardwood floors are installed however. Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. Nailing hardwood floors is almost always useless because if the glue is intact it will hold the planks but if it fails then nails wont help - stepping onto different parts of a plank that it not perfectly glued will make the plank bend slightly and pull the nails out and it gets loose over a course of month.</p>

<p>For instance if you have concrete subfloors nailing the hardwood floors is generally not possible unless you install about an inch thick plywood. Nail down installation may not be suitable for your home if particle board subfloor or the wood floor needs be installed over a concrete slab such as in basements or condos. This isnt really how hard hardwood floors are installed however. Face nail only the last row if it will be hidden by baseboard or quarter round gluing the last rows together at the tongue and groove will keep them connected enabling them to move with the rest of the floor through seasonal changes.

<p>Nailing hardwood floors is almost always useless because if the glue is intact it will hold the planks but if it fails then nails wont help - stepping onto different parts of a plank that it not perfectly glued will make the plank bend slightly and pull the nails out and it gets loose over a course of month. This is the most economical way to install a wood floor. With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks. On the other hand if you have a wooden sub-floor then theoretically either option will be open to you so you should choose the option that suits your DIY skills best if you are doing the work.

<p>Is glue down or nail down better for engineered wood flooring. Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. This is the most economical way to install a wood floor. If you choose to fix your hardwood floor into position you then have the choice of either gluing your floor to the subfloor using flexible flooring.
