<p>Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood. Manufacturers provide this budget-friendly waterproof and durable flooring type to fit your homes needs. A felt or foam backing makes vinyl softer than wood or tile which is helpful in bathrooms where slip-and-fall accidents are common on wet floors. While you might think that smaller tiles are best for a tiny bathroom large tiles actually create a sense of openness which can make your bathroom seem bigger or at least less cramped.
