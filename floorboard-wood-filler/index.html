<p>Versatile and convenient our range of professional grade wooden floor fillers are perfect for all sorts of floor repairs including filling gaps between floorboards filling splits and cracks in softwood and hardwood flooring and repairing small holes. Filling the gaps in your floorboards with StopGap is easy for anyone to do with no mess and no special tools required. I would advise putting masking tape either side of the gaps for a nice clean finish. This needs nitrocellulose lacquer along with sawdust.
