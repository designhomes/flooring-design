<p>One great benefits of gluing engineered wood flooring to the subfloor is that the end result is very stable. The glue-down method is commonly used in slab construction because it allows the flooring to be attached directly to a concrete slab. The least expensive method is the floating floor as you save between 150 and 250 per square foot when taking into consideration the cost of gluesealer and additional labor cost to install a glued down floor. Also they say that floating the floor is best because it tends to move as a unit to help accommodate moisture content changes.

<p>As far as the look of the floor goes there isnt much difference between floating and glued down floors. That said gluing down wood flooring is messier and more time-consuming and it requires a little more skill than installing floating wood floors does. Engineered hardwood flooring is more stable when glued down. Engineered hardwood products may be fastened stapled or glued on above or below grade.
