In order to keep pace with never ending demands of our customers, we are engaged in offering a quality assured range of hard wooden flooring to clients. Because of the huge range of flooring options, it can cost you anywhere from $80 per square metre for the most basic synthetic carpet to in excess of $200 per square metre for a genuine timber flooring system. Oak wood flooring is more expensive and costs around £1100 to be installed and is the cheapest real wood flooring. Engineered Oak Flooring Cost / Buying A Wood Floor Learn.</p>
