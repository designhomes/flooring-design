<p>In general engineered wood flooring is easier to install than hardwood since you can often skip the plywood subflooring. They are not a problem a little harder to keep clean as you have to sweep more often to prevent scratches but the look is well worth it. Make Your Kitchen an Urban Oasis. For engineered hardwood costs can be as little as 3 per square foot to as high as 13 depending on the type of wood the thickness of the veneer and the quality of the finish. Pin On Kitchen.</p>
