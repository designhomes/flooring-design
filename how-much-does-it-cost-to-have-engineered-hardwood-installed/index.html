<p>Buying your own wood and hiring a pro for installation might cost a bit more since pros get discounts on flooring but it lets you better control the type style and quality of planks you purchase. There will also be additional costs for floor fitting services such as underlay which you can read more about below. The installation process involves laying cutting and glueing the engineered wooden floor panels neatly and appropriately. For a 5m x 5m room installing an engineered wooden floor with a cost of 30 per square metre for the floor itself and 20 per square metre for installation would cost around 1400 taking extras into account. This option will cost around 6 per square foot but will vary depending on the type of wood you choose.</p>
