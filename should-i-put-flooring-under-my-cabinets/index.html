<p>How level the sub floor is shouldnt be an issue as each unit will have legs that are individually adjustable so a run of units can be adjusted to a uniform level.

If the floor cant expand it will buckle. Should I Put In A Hard Wood Floor In My Home Kitchen Flooring Hardwood Floors House Flooring.</p>
