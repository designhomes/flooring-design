<p>Bamboo and hardwood do have a similar look and feel and both materials are available both in 34-inch-thick solid planks and in engineered versions in which a finish-quality natural veneer is laminated over man-made core layers. Bamboo flooring can hold up to 25 years whereas Laminate flooring can hold up to 15 years. In general bamboo flooring costs more than laminate flooring. Bamboo is harder than some American hardwoods and it will last an average of 25 years depending on the environment on which is placed and the traffic received by it.
