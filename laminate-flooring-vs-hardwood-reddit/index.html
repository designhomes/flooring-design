<p>Its also less expensive. Laminate is made of one part wood and vinyl is made of 0 wood. Although the look of good laminate wood flooring.

<p>I did like that a couple of the laminate options came with a nice texture that would help hide scratches which is one of the only reasons I was considering it.

Although laminate flooring lacks the natural look and feel of hardwood flooring it is tougher making it a good option for homeowners with young children and pets.
