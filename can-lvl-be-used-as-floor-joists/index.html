<p>LVL has more of a holding power for fasteners than OSB rim board does so it makes sense to use LVL rim board in places that you will be attaching a future treated ledger board for a deck. So your double 66 can support at least 4000 lbs possibly more if you do a good job bonding the two members together so that theres no slip between the faces. I cant believe they were not packed to get the floor level when the house was built they just laid them on the lower level top plate ceiling below this room is flat. A double 212 beam can span 12 feet. I beam floor joists feature a top and bottom flange which is either a 23 24 or an LVL.</p>

<p>LVL has more of a holding power for fasteners than OSB rim board does so it makes sense to use LVL rim board in places that you will be attaching a future treated ledger board for a deck. Only thing i use lvls for is stair stringers it is nice having perfectly straight runs that are still strong after cutting out the notches and as a bonus it is very difficult to blow out one of the keys and having the square edge is nick also. Wesbeams engineered LVL beams are lightweight and strong making them ideal for use in floor construction. Several popular options include solid lumber LVL wood I-beams steel joists and open web floor trusses. Pin On Materials.</p>
