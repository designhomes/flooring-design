<p>To remove our old hardwood floors for example some stores we visited wanted another 3 per square foot. We installed a great looking fence but the customer complained knowing he could get a refund he had used Lowes on 4 previous projects and had received a total of 3500 in refunds to date. Remove and reattach the toilet- 70. I wonder how much of that came from people dumb enough to pay their fees.
