<p>SPC floors may not be as thick but they are considerably denser than WPC floors. If you have too thick of a veneer on an SPC core the wood will overpower the core and the flooring wont stay flat. A high-end laminate from just about anywhere I still like to look to Europe 3-7sf will also do the trick. The rigidity of SPC also allows it to provide more support underfoot while LVPs pliability gives it a softer more comfortable feel for walking on. Advantage of choosing engineered wood SPC Flooring is that it does not expand or contract with climate changes.</p>
