<p>Installing sub flooring, creating a level surface in older homes, and working to ensure that your floor looks and feels new for years to come is a special skill, one that not all dallas tx companies have. Reclaimed hardwood flooring has a rich story all its own, making it the perfect addition to any family home, cabin, or lake house. We do this by lifting the damaged floors, making sure the loosened boards are all secure, refitting or changing old boards and floorings or parquet blocks, and finally regluing. Hardwood floors come in many styles, and we can help you spark up an inspired idea. Reclaimed hardwood floor company in Dallas, Texas.</p>
