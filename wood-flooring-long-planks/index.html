<p><strong>Wood Flooring Long Planks</strong>, Because our product is custom we can use a wide variety of species with the added specialty of long lengths and options such as antiquing distressing wire-brushing hand beveling and hand scraping ensuring that each floor we produce is unique. If youre at the final stage of planning your wood flooring project the chances are youre wondering about whether you should invest in short random or long length wood flooring boards. This variety has planks that typically range from 60 - 72 long laminate flooring all designed to be installed in the same room. So whereas you might spend between 3 and 12 for regular solid hardwood per square foot you can expect to pay closer to 413 per square foot for wider planks.</p>
