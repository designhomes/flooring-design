<p>Engineered hardwood flooring is done in layers. It generally is 34 in thickness. Solid hardwood is timeless and gorgeous but lets face it high maintenance. When solid hardwood flooring is in an environment where the humidity level is over 55 then it will absorb the excess moisture and cupping will happen. But the most critical factor to deciding between solid or engineered is the type of home you live in where your home is located and your preferences as to the performance of your floor from season to season.</p>
