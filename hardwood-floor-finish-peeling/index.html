<p><strong>Hardwood Floor Finish Peeling</strong>, Im guessing you should sand the small area down to where the damage is gone while also providing mechanical bond for you to reapply finish. Continue reading Polyurethane flaking due to contaminant used between coats soap wax. Its better to have to paint on extra coats that will actually dry than to saturate the floor with a coat that doesnt dry which will lead to your polyurethane peeling again. Alot of times the product used on wood floors can harm then rather than do them good.</p>

<p>In the dining rooms and entry way there are rugs on the hardwood floors with no pads and apparently water must have been spilled in a couple of areas and has seeped through to the floor because the polyurethane is peeling off in long strips.

You can see the seam its kinda yellowed and that is where the peeling begins and of course it follows the length of the boards. Alot of times the product used on wood floors can harm then rather than do them good. The floors are scratching easily and you can peel away the poly with your fingernail.</p>
