<p>A major factor when choosing an upstairs floor is the noise level of the flooring type. This is done is by removing the ceiling drywall and inserting enough fiberglass or rockwool insulation to fill the joist space.

When you show the units you could always just mention that they will hear their neighbors come and go and walk around though there are generally no noise issues beyond that.
