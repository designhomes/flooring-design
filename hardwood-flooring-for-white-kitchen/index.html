<p>Exotic wood flooring looks very nice. In that case going with a light wood floor with white cabinets will bounce more light around your kitchen and give you that look you want. You will pay per square foot so keep the size of your kitchen in mind while shopping. Pine or golden oak options as long as they arent too yellow will add just enough color contrast to let your kitchen stand out without overwhelming the room. Pin On Kitchens.</p>
