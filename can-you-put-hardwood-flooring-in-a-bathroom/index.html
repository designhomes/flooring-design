<p>Unless properly treated and sealed by professionals or prefinished specifically for a bathroom floor a wooden floor can develop moisture problems especially under the toilet. In addition to the cost of materials expect to pay anywhere from 3 to 8 per square foot for professional installation. It might be fine in a small guest lavatory but should not be used where a shower or bathtub will be in frequent use. Laying tile is much more time consuming and not to mention more expensive if you are hiring someone to do it.

<p>The hard work will be worth it in my opinion. Solid Hardwood Flooring is Not a Good Choice for Bathrooms. Hardwood is a better bathroom flooring choice than say carpet but it can still be very problematic. Although obviously most people would prefer the wood to look finished and for it to be protected a bit from stains etc. Bathroom Remodel Complete Centsational Girl Small Bathroom Remodel Bathroom Makeover Bathrooms Remodel.</p>
