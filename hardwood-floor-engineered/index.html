<p>Shaw engineered hardwood flooring brings Beauty and Strength to Any Room. Engineered timber flooring has a layer of natural hardwood beneath layers of protective coatings providing the same luxurious look and feel as solid timber floorboards. Solid wood flooring is better suited to installing over plywood surfaces. Typically engineered wood floors are more affordable than hardwood floors because they only contain a small layer of hardwood yet they give the appearance of true hardwood.
