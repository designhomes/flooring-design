<p>We are going Oak in our new home even though I really dont like it. It may also be difficult to sand due to the density of this wood. You can have your installer select andor test the stain colors as well as make sure they get the matching wood eg. Oak wood naturally has a fine grain that makes an attractive flooring surface.

<p>Its softer than red oak but is still a strong wood. The longevity and appearance of all solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring depends more on the conditions and method of installation. A lower score than hickory doesnt necessarily mean its a worse option it just means its a little softer. Had we bought in Half Moon Bay and had access to Mirage flooring I would have went with the Alaska color white. Bona Birch Stain On White Oak House Flooring Staining Wood White Oak.</p>
