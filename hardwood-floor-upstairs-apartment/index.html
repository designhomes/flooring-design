<p>When you show the units you could always just mention that they will hear their neighbors come and go and walk around though there are generally no noise issues beyond that. Unless the upstairs neighbor is willing to install a sound isolating flooring underlay to maintain the appropriate sound isolation the downstairs neighbor is bound to be victimized by intrusive noise. A long time ago I had guy living above me in an apartment who I discovered was having prostitutes come over upstairs. Especially if you had bad 80s carpet beforehand.

<p>Hardwood floors can add elegance and aesthetic appeal to apartments. The master bedroom is also a good place to install hardwood or hardwood laminate flooring. Youll rent the units faster and get more money for them with hardwood floors. Beyond the strictly cosmetic benefits wood floors also provide adequate insulation and they feel pretty nice underfoot.
